It allows users to view events, news, manage profiles, and participate in association activities.

It provides RESTful APIs for frontend clients to interact with the database and perform various operations related to member management, event management, and more.

Please refer to the [README](./softy-events-backend/readme.md) file in the `softy-events-backend` directory for more information on setting up and running the backend application.
